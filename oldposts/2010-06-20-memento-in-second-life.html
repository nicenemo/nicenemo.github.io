After grasping the power of Memoize in VB.NET and C# tried my luck at making a memoizing fibonacci generator in Second Life's scripting Language LSL. <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> is 3d virtual world where end users can create there own world using basic building blocks. They can script their creation with a scripting language called LSL. This languages get's compiled to Mono's runtime. <br />LSL is somewhat limited. It does not allow for closures or lambda functions. It also has a very limited set of datatypes. It does not have arrays. It has immutable lists. A list in LSL can contain elements of string, integer and other types but not lists themselves. For Fibonacci a list with only integers will do. <br />I  defined fib(n) first using it's recursive definition to get the LSL right. Of course this doesn 't perform at all. After that I looked into memoizing. I noticed that inserting integers in a list is an expensive operation in LSL. However the nature of the Fibonacci algorithm makes this not necessary. The cache will always be filled in order from n=0 up to the requested number. I preseeded the list with [0,1,1] which eliminates one if clause. after that the fib function is recursively called and the results are added to the cache. Below is the final code <br /><pre>list cache=[0,1,1];<br />integer  fib(integer n)<br />{<br />    integer result;<br />    <br />    if (n&lt;llGetListLength(cache))<br />    {<br />        result= llList2Integer(cache, n);<br />    }<br />    else<br />    {<br />        result=fib(n-1)+fib(n-2);<br />        cache=(cache=[])+cache+result;<br />    }<br />    return result;<br />}<br />default<br />{<br />    <br />   <br />    state_entry()<br />    {<br />        llSay(0, "Hello, Avatar!");<br />    }<br /><br />    touch_start(integer total_number)<br />    {<br />        integer i;<br />        for(i=0;i<47 done="" fib="" i="" llsay="" pre="" string=""></47></pre>
