Please let us break the terror of the typewriter. In daily life we use symbols in many places because plain text does not work. Symbols are a more succinct(less verbose) in expressing, Numbers(0,1,2..9), Math, Music, Chemistry, Religion, army ranks, marketing, smilies, and many other uses. It allow you to see the forest for the trees and not cluttering your work with common knowledge that can be easily expressed using a symbol, E.g. using ForEach or Sigma symbol instead of using ForEach and Sigma in text over and over again in a formula. Road signs exist for a reason. In traffic you need to evaluate them in a short amount of time. Road signs mainly express a message using shape, size, colour orientation and location. Imagine the overnight change of all road signs with plain square white signs with black four word texts. People are no longer able to instantly see the more important signs. As a side effect the economy would grind down to a halt because people are driving slower due to all the sign reading... What If I change the road sign texts from English to Chinese. In Software Engineering the use of Design Pattern is (getting) common knowledge. Patterns such as Iterator do not need to be explained/defined over and over again because software engineers were trained in using them. Using ASCII to express symbols is often very inefficient, e.g.: ManagerSatisfactionBonusRateFactorReasonerEnum. When literally translated to Chinese using a translation service this gets reduced to fifteen(15) characters. A lot of people in the world speak Chinese. Maybe for programming in general it may be useful to learn Chinese because it is more expressive characterwise. Once taught the symbols of the examples mentioned above allow for a more efficient expression in the domain these symbols are meant for. The question should be what can be gained in expressiveness using symbols versus the effort to teach people/adapt tools to deal with (unicode) symbols? Choosing identifier names wisely regarding common practice and the problem domain comes first. Using unicode may be a useful tool in reducing the clutter when education and tooling is taken care of.
