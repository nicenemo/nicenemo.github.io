        <p>For quite a while I am looking into faster, smaller and hopefully more ergonomic keyboards.
Below you will find a selection of my thoughts on <em>(custom build)</em> mechanical keyboards.</p>

<p>On a keyboard, the <em>home row</em> is the row that you rest your fingers on on a keyboard.Typically the second row from the bottom. On a 40% keyboard, every key you need is on the <em>&ldquo;home row&rdquo;</em> or one row above or below the <em>&ldquo;home row&rdquo;</em>. For other keys you switch modes, or layers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKGXZ1ReU54">Move the keys to your fingers</a>, not your fingers to the keys.</p>

<p>A custom mechanical keyboard with all options ticked is quite expensive and is easily priced between €200,- and €300,- Therefore I thought it to be  wise to emulate and try 40% and 60% keyboard first. I found a project that emulated QMK style layered keyboards using <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a> <em>(AHK)</em>. AutoHotKey is a keyboard macro utility (and much more) for Windows. I <a href="https://github.com/nicenemo/AutoHotkey">cloned and modified the project</a>, so that I have 40% and 60% keyboards on a normal 100% keyboard with the extra keys blocked and support for layers.</p>

<p>The percentage does not mean that keys are shrunk, but how many keys are still left on the keyboard. Keyboards with smaller keys do exist too! There are variations of 60% and 40% keyboards that do have cursor keys instead of right alt, Windows, shift and control keys. So less is more! Can we go further? Maybe 30%? Keyboards with less keys do exist, think about separate numeric or macro pads. Other are for more specialist use, e.g. like the ones stenographers use. One handed keyboards such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FrogPad">FrogPad</a> is another category. I am not sure what the use case is for that except for people with disabilities. In theory one key is enough to press all keys, it just requires something like Morse code to type all the keys. Hobby projects for such keyboards do exist. Keyboards with way more keys also do exist. Examples are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard">Space Cadet Keyboard</a>. It has both a Hyper and a Super key. It allows for easy entering of mathematical formulas. If you want to take it to the max you can go for a Space Cadet inspired keyboard, the <a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/hyper_7_keyboard.html">Hyper 7</a> Another insane keyboard is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FHkQpYBygE">Wytec MK6</a> a keyboard with 3 build-in screens and a KVM. This one is mainly marketed for trading floors but can also be used in other Command &amp; Control theatres.</p>

<p>As a computer science student in 1994, I was introduced to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">Vi</a> not <a href="https://vim.org">Vim</a>, but the real thing, Vi. Vi is an advanced editor that distinguishes itself from other editors by utilizing modes. The cursor keys, delete key, backspace key etc are not used. Instead in Vi you are in command mode first. You use <em>h,j,k,l</em> and other keys to move around and edit. This has the advantage of not moving your hands. Moving your hands to the cursor keys and back slows you down. Using the normal cursor keys can also be painful, if you suffer from RSI. Entering text in Vi, is done by switching to input mode first. You do this, by pressing  the <em>i</em> key. When done entering text, going back to <em>command mode</em> is done by pressing the <em>Escape</em> key.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2020. I am still interested in working faster and more comfortable. I use Vi in it&rsquo;s <a href="https://spacevim.org/">SpaceVim</a> incarnation with <a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVim</a>. I like it so much that I, <em>wannabe</em>, try to configure Vim key bindings in other programs when possible. This sometimes works well, but sadly not always. Printing out and learning some hotkeys of <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/CollectingWindows10AnniversaryEditionKeyboardShortcuts.aspx">Windows</a> or Mac and your favourite programs may help. There must be a better way, I thought. What if my keyboard has a Vi modus? I knew about so called 10 keys less (TKL) keyboards. These are similar to common laptop keyboards in the sense that they ditch the numeric parts. But can you go further? Yes of course you can. So called 60% keyboards exist, e.g.  the <a href="https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-Mecha-Mini">Ducky Mecha Mini</a> and similar from other brands. These are popular among gamers. These do not only ditch the numeric pad but also go without the function keys,  NAV cluster and cursor keys. These keys and the numeric pads are made available by switching layers using a special key or by pressing a key like shift briefly or twice. This is similar to pressing caps lock on a traditional keyboard or using modes like in Vi. This requires adjustments. However, with a 60% keyboard I still have one row to many. The rows with the numbers is two rows away from the <em>&ldquo;home row&rdquo;</em>. Ditch that row and you get a so called 40% keyboard. The numbers and function keys are available on a layer. The numbers are also available as a numeric pad on another layer. On such a keyboard you can imagine shifting the function keys and number keys virtually present above the top row. You can shift them under your fingers by activating a layer.</p>

<p>Besides number of keys, keyboards can also  differ in layout:</p>

<table>
<thead>

<th align="left">layout</th>
<th align="left">remark</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">horizontal staggered</td>
<td align="left">The rows are shifted a little less than half a key from each other.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">vertical staggered</td>
<td align="left">The columns are shifted a little less than half a key from each other.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">Ortholinear</td>
<td align="left">All keys are in a grid, like in the normal numpad.</td>

<tr>
<td align="left">Split</td>
<td align="left">The keyboard is split in two halves connected by a wire.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">Ergonomic</td>
<td align="left">Halves at an angle and there is a so called thumb cluster</td>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>Combinations of a split, ergonomic with horizontal or vertical staggering or ortholinear keyboards do exist.</p>

            <h4>Planck 40% Ortholinear layout</h4>
        </figcaption>

<p>I like the Ortholinear 40% keyboards, such as the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck">Planck</a> or the <a href="https://kbdfans.com/products/fully-assembled-niu40-mechanical-keyboard">Niu40</a>. They force you to use layers and are portable too! However I am a bit worried about my shoulders and back when using such a tiny keyboard. Therefore a 40% split ergonomic keyboard with thumb cluster might be more suitable. This allows me to place the two halves apart so that I will not sit with bent shoulders. I can even rest the two halves on the sides of an arm chair and pretend I am captain Picard.</p>

<p>Most of the above keyboards are sold as DIY kits that need soldering. There are shops that offer completed kits or a soldering service. Some kits do not need soldering but come with hot swap sockets. In that case you only push the switches into the circuit board and then put the key caps on top of the switches. Quite often the kits or completed sets are sold in so called group buys. You order and after a certain number of people ordered to your credit card or PayPal is charged and the keyboard or kit goes into production. This allows you to buy a high quality keyboard that otherwise would cost a fortune.</p>

<p>Switches is another dimension of choice. There are different brands, clicky, silent, tactile, linear, low profile, optical, hall effect and probably many more switches from different brand. I think I go for <a href="https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx-original/mx-brown.html">Cherry browns</a>, like in my current &ldquo;Das keyboard&rdquo; or perhaps I go for tactile <a href="https://zealpc.net/">Zealeos from ZealPC</a>. I am not a gamer so I am not that interested in linear ones.</p>

<p>The next dimension is keycaps. Actually keycaps is a universe on it&rsquo;s own.
There are different sizes, <a href="https://thekeeblog.com/overview-of-different-keycap-profiles/">profiles</a> and materials to choose from. The problem with my wife&rsquo;s current Das Keyboard is that the legends wear off.
I guess that will happen to mine too in the near future if I continue to use it more. Keycaps that do not have that problem are so called double shot keycaps. They consist of two plastic layers. With a laser the letters are cut out. Another option is PBT keycaps with Dye sublimated lettering. The letters look better and you do not feel them. To get an idea on what I wanted I first spent some time browsing Ali Express for keycaps and then looked at a few other sites too. Since I wanted a split ergonomic keyboard I opted for an ortholinear keycap set. I went for the  MATT3O /DEV/TTY MT3 CUSTOM KEYCAP SET which I bought as a group buy from <a href="https://drop.com">Drop</a>. I went for these because they look good. I do fancy a space cadet key set, I really do, but the legends on that are less readable. Something I did not buy is a so called artisan key. These are single keys with a sculpture on top or in the key. Sorry not my cup of tea. It must be usable.</p>

<p>Unlike your EU 14,- keyboard, keyboards like described above are driven by Arduino style controllers, tiny internet of things mini computers. These come with Micro USB, Mini USB and USB-C connections. Although I have a few spare micro USB cables I do not fancy paying a fortune for a cable in a few years. So I want one with an USB-C connector. For a split you need two. Probably my keyboard will be driven by two <a href="https://keeb.io/products/elite-c-usb-c-pro-micro-replacement-arduino-compatible-atmega32u4">Elite-C</a> chips. <em>Did you know that the first PC keyboards where driven by a Z80 processor, almost as powerful as the processor in the PC itself?</em></p>

<p>The boards I am looking at are running <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a> firmware and come with layered layouts by default.
There are a zillion different boards running this open source firmware, that is actively developed. Other boards come with their own firmware and standard layouts.</p>

<p>LEDs. Some boards come with LEDs on top and on the bottom, or yo can add them as an option. I do not like disco lights. As long as I can turn them off that is fine. An indication for what layer I am would be nice. More civilized lighting of the keyboard can be useful when using the keyboard during a summer night from the garden. Some split keyboards com with oLED screens as options. These allow you to show the layer you are in and maybe other uses. I am not sure if I need/want that. It&rsquo;s cool and geeky sure!</p>

<p>Since I want a split keyboard I need an extra cable between the parts. That cable cannot be too long, I read. I hope long enough for the Captain Picard command chair scenario ;). I still have to look into that.</p>

<p>Cases for keyboards come also in all kinds of styles, sizes and materials. I prefer it as flat as possible for health reasons. I do not want to have my wrists at an awkward angle. For easy cleaning a simple plate with the switches and keycaps floating above it would be awesome. I also want to travel with it. So it either should be sturdy enough or I need a sturdy enough protective case. I heard that some people carry a Kyria around in a Doctor&rsquo;s stethoscope carrying case.</p>

<p>In taking minimalizing hardware to the next level, I wonder, whether in a few years time I will use such a keyboard, a portable screen and my phone. I recently had to use my phone&rsquo;s desktop mode because my laptop broke down and I needed to do some work. It was not perfect but doable. Some of the apps were made for phone use and did not have the advanced features of their desktop counterparts. My phone is powerful enough to run a compiler and IDE. I actually tried to do some development work using Vim and a Bluetooth keyboard. The screen resolution is as high as my desktop. The screen is just not big enough to work comfortable. Portable USB-C screens do exist&hellip;. Tempting&hellip;</p>
