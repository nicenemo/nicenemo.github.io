My final goal is getting Kubernetes running on SmartOS.
At home, I run SmartOS on a PC, that I use as a little NAS and some server tasks. It is low energy but has some power to run some virtualization tasks. Specifications:
Intel I7 T series 35 Watt TDP, Passively cooled 32 Gb memory 2X 2 TB disks, ZFS, mirrored SSD as log device boot from USB stick Passive cooled CPU Big tower case with big slow turning fans SmartOS is a free and open-source hypervisor platform supporting several flavours of virtualization.</description></item></channel></rss>
