A a selection of the split keyboards I looked into:

Most of the above keyboards are sold as DIY kits that need soldering. There are shops that offer completed kits or a soldering service. Some kits do not need soldering but come with hot swap sockets. In that case you only push the switches into the circuit board and then put the key caps on top of the switches. Quite often the kits or completed sets are sold in so called group buys. You order and after a certain number of people ordered to your credit card or PayPal is charged and the keyboard or kit goes into production. This allows you to buy a high quality keyboard that otherwise would cost a fortune.

Switches is another dimension of choice. There are different brands, clicky, silent, tactile, linear, low profile, optical, hall effect and probably many more switches from different brand. I think I go for [Cherry browns](https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx-original/mx-brown.html), like in my current "Das keyboard" or perhaps I go for tactile [Zealeos from ZealPC](https://zealpc.net/). I am not a gamer so I am not that interested in linear ones.

The next dimension is keycaps. Actually keycaps is a universe on it's own.
There are different sizes, [profiles](https://thekeeblog.com/overview-of-different-keycap-profiles/) and materials to choose from. The problem with my wife's current Das Keyboard is that the legends wear off.
I guess that will happen to mine too in the near future if I continue to use it more. Keycaps that do not have that problem are so called double shot keycaps. They consist of two plastic layers. With a laser the letters are cut out. Another option is PBT keycaps with Dye sublimated lettering. The letters look better and you do not feel them. To get an idea on what I wanted I first spent some time browsing Ali Express for keycaps and then looked at a few other sites too. Since I wanted a split ergonomic keyboard I opted for an ortholinear keycap set. I went for the  MATT3O /DEV/TTY MT3 CUSTOM KEYCAP SET which I bought as a group buy from [Drop](https://drop.com). I went for these because they look good. I do fancy a space cadet key set, I really do, but the legends on that are less readable. Something I did not buy is a so called artisan key. These are single keys with a sculpture on top or in the key. Sorry not my cup of tea. It must be usable.

Unlike your € 14,- keyboard, the boards above are driven by Arduino style controllers, tiny internet of things mini computers. These come with Micro USB, Mini USB and USB-C connections. Although I have a few spare micro USB cables I do not fancy paying a fortune for a cable in a few years. So I want one with an USB-C connector. For a split you need two. Probably my keyboard will be driven by two [Elite-C](https://keeb.io/products/elite-c-usb-c-pro-micro-replacement-arduino-compatible-atmega32u4) chips. _Did you know that the first PC keyboards where driven by a Z80 processor, almost as powerful as the processor in the PC itself?_

The boards I am looking at are running [QMK](https://qmk.fm/) firmware and come with layered layouts by default.
There are a zillion different boards running this open source firmware, that is actively developed. Other boards come with their own firmware and standard layouts.

LEDs. Some boards come with LEDs on top and on the bottom, or yo can add them as an option. I do not like disco lights. As long as I can turn them off that is fine. An indication for what layer I am would be nice. More civilized lighting of the keyboard can be useful when using the keyboard during a summer night from the garden. Some split keyboards com with oLED screens as options. These allow you to show the layer you are in and maybe other uses. I am not sure if I need/want that. It's cool and geeky sure!

Since I want a split keyboard I need an extra cable between the parts. That cable cannot be too long, I read. I hope long enough for the Captain Picard command chair scenario ;). I still have to look into that.

Cases for keyboards come in all kinds of styles, sizes and materials. I prefer it as flat as possible for health reasons. I do not want to have my wrists at an awkward angle. For easy cleaning a simple plate with the switches and keycaps floating above it would be awesome. I want to travel with my keyboard too. So it either should be sturdy enough or I need a sturdy enough protective case. I heard that some people carry a Kyria around in a Doctor's stethoscope carrying case.

A standard mechanical keyboard is usually 10x more expensive than a keyboard.

| keyboard         | Price |
| :--------------- | ----: |
| Budget keyboard  |   €14 |
| Apple keyboard   |  €149 |
| Das Keyboard     |  €149 |
| Ducky Mecha mini |  €145 |

A custom mechanical keyboard is easily 20x more expensive than a budget keyboard. This is because, they are produced in smaller batches. They may be single custom-builds, only for you. The components used can be of higher quality than mass-produced keyboards. The most expensive components for these boards are the switches, the keycaps and soldering/assembling costs. If you do the soldering and assembling your self you can save on costs if you already have an electronics soldering station and related equipment.
 Plastic and aluminium anodized cases are affordable and in the €20 - €40 price range. However, more expensive options in the €100 or over €200 price range in wood or polished metal do exist. Cases for split ergonomic boards tend to be more expensive because of the angled non-boxy shape they require.

I live in the EU and I have to source the parts from China, The UK or USA. I have to pay 21% VAT and a handling fee for anything above €22,- There are no import tariffs on computer parts, so I am fine there. Because of the VAT, it makes sense to see whether I can source components from within the EU or find someone local who can solder for me. Another trick is ordering ordering a board that accepts socketed switches and requires no further soldering. This allows you to split the order into keycaps, switches and stabilizers, board, casing, cables. For most parts you will not be able to stay below the €22,- tax free limit, but you can optimize by sourcing some parts from the EU.

One might wonder whether a custom board with an Arduino chip is a security risk? In normal operational use the boards are configured as USB-HID profile keyboard. That means they can only send keystrokes and receive led status notifications from the PC. Only in firmware flash mode you can infect the keyboard with something special. This true for most advanced keyboards. However, being a small computer, these custom chips can be programmed to be rogue and act as a key logger. You can even let it be some other USB device, e.g. mass-storage, network or serial port. As a keyboard they can blindly fire key sequences to your PC and perform commands with your privileges Adding a key logger or worse in between your keyboard using a commercial of the shelve hacking/penetration testing device is much easier to do. You can hide that in the USB plugs at the office, or in the USB monitor hub. If your keyboard is big enough they can hide it in your keyboard. Some would say that banning USB all together would solve the problem. However even an old-fashioned PS/2 or DIN connected keyboard can be fitted with a WiFi controlled key logger or worse. If the computer is hacked it can even communicate back more via the control signals of the status leds. In this way you can evade local network security. The monitor at your office is even more at a risk. You can add something extra to the monitor. Nobody would wonder if an USB Hub in your monitor has a few extra devices. Power is not a problem and also there is often enough space to hide a powerful computer like a Raspberry Pi. You can tap into the video signal and record that. More interesting you can hide extra data in the scan lines or least significant bits of the video signal and record & transmit that instead. So I do not worry about a custom keyboard to be hacked more than I do for other equipment at the office. Maybe I worry less because my custom keyboard would be more likely with me and not left unattended at the office. Of course leaving a second keyboard, to save on carrying gear, at the office unattended is a risk.

In taking minimalizing hardware to the next level, I wonder whether in a few years time I will use such a keyboard, a portable screen and my phone. I recently had to use my phone's desktop mode because my laptop broke down and I needed to do some work. It was not perfect but doable. Some apps were made for phone use and did not have the advanced features of their desktop counterparts. My phone is powerful enough to run a compiler and IDE. I tried to do some development work using Vim and a Bluetooth keyboard. The screen resolution is as high as my desktop. The screen is just not big enough to work comfortable. Portable USB-C screens do exist.... Tempting...
